about: **This issue tracker is for reporting bugs in django-apscheduler only!** There are much better sources for obtaining information and howto guides for the up stream [APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com) projects. Please use them as we unfortunately do not have the capacity to respond to general requests for assistance here.
